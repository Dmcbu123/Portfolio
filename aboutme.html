<p style="font-size:180%;"> I don't know what to say about myself but I guess my drawings are considered my talent. This is pretty much
 my first time doing something like this...
<p style="font-size:180%;"> This Pink cat Boi is just one of my many artworks (lol I didn't know what else to put but there is more 
 art to come)

   <h1> HMTL Reflection </h1>
   <p style="font-size:180%;"> One way I try making my website accessible to all users is by making the website 
   certain way in order for others to understand it. The things that I find other using on their websites that looked cool to me 
   is the use of the templates because i never thought of using a template for my work. The way how they did it is looking up HTML templates
   on the w3schools website and found it that way. I am proud of learning how to make my own website because one day I'll be able 
   to advertise and/or promote my artwork to others.

  <p style="font-size:180%;">The definition of Core4 is the 4 main essentials of coding. Variables are basically certain characters 
   or objects in a program. Loops would usually repeat the sequence a block at a time. For an example, If iI wanted to draw a square 
   in Python and not type up the same process every time I would use the two types of loops which is a for loop and a while loop. 
   A For-loop is when it executes the code using a loop variable (and a range(). Where as a While loop uses conditionals to repeat 
   the looping process.
   
  <h1> HMTL Reflection </h1>
  <p style="font-size:180%;">Today we learned about data structures. Listing (in Python) is a data structure that stores data of any 
   data type than you choose.Also a list contains brackets and you can change it if you want to. The reason why this was useful is 
   because it kindof helped me organize my work or listings. I felt that working with my partner Chloe was the best because we both 
   helped eachother when we both didnt know what to do and figured it out in the end. (\ ^ v ^ /) We also did a project today that 
   was called Obamicon which created a change of the colors (RGB) in a certain pictures due to the pixels.

   <h1> Robotics Lesson: <h1> 
   <p style="font-size:110%;"> During the Robotics lesson I learned how to use Arduino Uno and Arduino adafruit. Using TinkerCat helped 
    me test out experiments just in case if anything goes wrong or is completley sucessful. We had people come in to help us in the 
    workshop dealing with the adafruit and arduino coding. It was a really fun experience putting in certain codes that would activate 
    the robot to change colors or make noises with the sensors. The people that came were so nice to ask if we needed help if 
    we struggled on something. I hope and appricate everyone that came in.
  
  <h1> Robotics Lesson: <h1>
  <p style="font-size:110%;"> Today we went to Gibson Dunn today and I really liked the warm welcome and introduction that
   each and everyone one of the speakers gave us. Everybody's speeches that they gave on their experiences with certain 
   issues or cases dealing with technology made the presentations really inspiring and engaging. The speech with Abbey Hudson 
   was really funny and I enjoyed her presentation.

   <h1> JavaScript: <h1>
   <p style="font-size:110%;">Today we did JavaScript and it was really fun. JavaScript had to mostly do with us typing up 
    a certain code that makes our web pages on GitHub more interactive and not dull/boring. What I did was just draw 
    my Pink Cat Boy twice with two different expressions and making the buttons so you can change his expression 
    everytime you click the button "Change Me!".
    
    <h1> Django: <h1>
   <p style="font-size:110%;">Today we did Django which is a web framework that works with python. It was really challenging 
    going through every step of Django and having to deal with errors half of the time. It was pretty cool to be the one that 
    is upahead of some other people so if anyone needed some help if they come up with an error either I or someone else can 
    help them on that struggle because It could be the same problem we had or I just know what to do.
    
    <h1> IPSoft Field Trip: <h1>
   <p style="font-size:110%;"> Today we went to IPSoft and was welcomed by the staff that works on Amelia. The experience was fun going 
    to this place and learning more on who Amelia is and how she works. The presentations of some of the staff members were very 
    interactive using Amelia for examples. Also, having a tour around IPSoft was really cool seeing other people work on new advances 
    for Amelia. It was fun and intresting and hope to work with them one day in the future if I possibly major in Computer Science.
