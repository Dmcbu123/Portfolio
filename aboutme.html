   <h1> HMTL Reflection </h1>
  <p style="font-size:180%;"> One way I try making my website accessible to all users is by making the website 
   certain way in order for others to understand it. The things that I find other using on their websites that looked cool to me 
   is the use of the templates because i never thought of using a template for my work. The way how they did it is looking up HTML templates
   on the w3schools website and found it that way. I am proud of learning how to make my own website because one day I'll be able 
   to advertise and/or promote my artwork to others.

 The definition of Core4 is the 4 main essentials of coding. 
  Variables are basically certain characters or objects in a program. 
  Loops would usually repeat the sequence a block at a time. For an example, If iI wanted to draw a square in Python and not type up the same process every time 
   I would use the two types of loops which is a for loop and a while loop.  A For-loop is when it executes the code using a loop 
   variable (and a range(). Where as a While loop uses conditionals to repeat the looping process
