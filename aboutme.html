 my first time doing something like this...
<p style="font-size:180%;"> This Pink cat Boi is just one of my many artworks (lol I didn't know what else to put but there is more 
 art to come)

   <h1> HMTL Reflection </h1>
  <p style="font-size:180%;"> One way I try making my website accessible to all users is by making the website 
   certain way in order for others to understand it. The things that I find other using on their websites that looked cool to me 
   is the use of the templates because i never thought of using a template for my work. The way how they did it is looking up HTML templates
   on the w3schools website and found it that way. I am proud of learning how to make my own website because one day I'll be able 
   to advertise and/or promote my artwork to others.

 The definition of Core4 is the 4 main essentials of coding. 
  Variables are basically certain characters or objects in a program. 
  Loops would usually repeat the sequence a block at a time. For an example, If iI wanted to draw a square in Python and not type up the same process every time 
   I would use the two types of loops which is a for loop and a while loop.  A For-loop is when it executes the code using a loop 
   variable (and a range(). Where as a While loop uses conditionals to repeat the looping process

   Today we learned about data structures. Listing (in Python) is a data structure that stores data of any data type than you choose.
   Also a list contains brackets and you can change it if you want to. The reason why this was useful is because it kindof helped me 
   organize my work or listings. I felt that working with my partner Chloe was the best because we both helped eachother when we both 
   didnt know what to do and figured it out in the end. (\ ^ v ^ /) We also did a project today that was called Obamicon which created 
   a change of the colors (RGB) in a certain pictures due to the pixels.

   <p style="font-size:180%;"> 
    During the Robotics lesson I learned how to use Arduino Uno and Arduino adafruit. Using TinkerCat helped me test out experiments 
    just in case if anything goes wrong or is completley sucessful. We had people come in to help us in the workshop dealing with the
    adafruit and arduino coding. It was a really fun experience putting in certain codes that would activate the robot to change colors 
    or make noises with the sensors. The people that came were so nice to ask if we needed help if we struggled on something. I hope and appricate everyone that came in.

   Today we went to Gibson Dunn today and I really liked the warm welcome and introduction that each and everyone one of the speakers gave us.
   Everybody's speeches that they gave on their experiences with certain issues or cases dealing with technology made the presentations really 
   inspiring and engaging. The speech with Abbey Hudson was really funny and I enjoyed her presentation.
