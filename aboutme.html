<p style="font-size:180%;"> I don't know what to say about myself but I guess my drawings are considered my talent. This is pretty much
 my first time doing something like this...
<p style="font-size:180%;"> This Pink cat Boi is just one of my many artworks (lol I didn't know what else to put but there is more 
 art to come)

<h1> About Me </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%;"> I am typically an anxiety filled 18 year old who is really shy (to speak up for themseleves). I have a
 (really obvious) dream in becoming an artist and still would probably like to persue that dream...

   <h1> HMTL Reflection </h1>
  <p style="font-size:180%;"> One way I try making my website assesible to all users is by making the website 
   certain way in order for others to understand it. The things that I find other using on their websites that looked cool to me 
   is the use of the templates because i never thought of using a template for my work. The way how they did it is looking up HTML templates
   on the w3schools website and found it that way. I am proud of learning how to make my own website because one day I'll be able 
   to advertise and/or promote my artwork to others.
